# IV - [Backing services](https://12factor.net/backing-services)

*Treat backing services as attached resources*

Node-RED naturally fits this way of working, with a large community of developers creating nodes to access many different services that can be run on the same host as Node-RED or may be accessed via API.

Like all programming languages Node-RED can be used to create applications that do not comply with the 12-factor methodology, so developers need to be choose the nodes they use and the features of Node-RED to ensure they are creating 12-factor apps.  In reality this is no different from other programming languages, e.g. a Node.js developer needs to evaluate packages they choose to adopt.
