# Part 5 - 12-Factor Apps with Node-RED to take to production

This section looks at creating native cloud applications using Node-RED and how the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net) methodology can be applied to Node-RED.

## I    - [Codebase](CODEBASE.md)

One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

## II   - [Dependencies](DEPENDENCIES.md)

Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

## III  - [Config](CONFIG.md)

Store config in the environment

## IV   - [Backing Services](BACKING.md)

Treat backing services as attached resources

## V    - [Build, release, eun](BUILD.md)

Strictly separate build and run stages

## VI   - [Processes](PROCESSES.md)

Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

## VII  - [Port binding](PORT.md)

Export services via port binding

## VIII - [Concurrency](CONCURRENCY.md)

Scale out via the process model

## IX   - [Disposability](DISPOSABILITY.md)

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

## X    - [Dev/prod parity](PARITY.md)

Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

## XI   - [Logs](LOGS.md)

Treat logs as event streams

## XII  - [Admin processes](ADMIN.md)

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
